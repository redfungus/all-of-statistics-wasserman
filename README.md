# Wasserman All of Statistics

This repo contains My solutions to Wasserman All of Statistics computer experiments.
The repo also contains a .devcontainer folder with a VSCode development environment configuration that has all the libraries needed for performing the experiments.

I've tried to use [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for my plotting needs to also learn that along the way.
