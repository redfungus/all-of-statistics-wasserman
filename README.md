# Wasserman All of Statistics

This repo contains My solutions to Wasserman All of Statistics. 
- The experiments are in the `Computer Experiments` folder.
- The Exercises are available (handwritten so not the most readable) in pdf and OneNote format. 

The repo also contains a .devcontainer folder with a VSCode development environment configuration that has all the libraries needed for performing the experiments.

I've tried to use [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for my plotting needs to also learn that along the way.
